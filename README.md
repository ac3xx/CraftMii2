## Welcome to CraftMii
# CraftMii is a Minecraft client for iOS.

- Infos
* CraftMii aims to be fully compatible with 1.2.5.
* 1.3 compatibility can be added easily, but we at least need to get 1.2.5's world rendered
* I fail at OpenGL. The whole OGL thing /is/ broken. MCChunk has issues (sections corrupted for some reason etc.)
* Less CPU usage as possible, even if it requires a lot of RAM.
* Code may have leaks. It's a pre-pre-alpha, getting it to work is enough. RAM usage will be improved in the future.
* All the code on this git repo is (c) Evolse Ltd.
* You may modify the code as long as you do not sell it / distribute it in binary form. Please always indicate 'qwertyoruiop' _or_ 'Evolse Ltd.' as the app's creator, even if you modified it.
* If you do modify the code and improve the app, we kindly ask you to fork the repo and send us a pull request.
* terrain.png is copyrighted by Mojang. Sorry for that, I don't even use it at the moment. I should remove it or make it work decently (and get Mojang's permission to use it / user alternative artwork for it).
